# Chatarum
The working title comes from the Latin word for a card game (ludus chatarum).

(Currently the sourcecode is in English and the documentation is in Finnish - might change it all to English soon)

*30.1.2015:* The game isn't in playable form yet. Next week's plan is to write a proper game design document and make the first playable iteration with 1 hero, 6 different minions and text based user interface.
