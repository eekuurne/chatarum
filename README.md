# Chatarum
The working title comes from the Latin word for a card game (ludus chatarum).

The "dokumentointi"-folder includes the game's documentation during the course "Ohjelmoinnin harjoitustyö" where I made the game itself and "tira_dokumentointi"-folder includes the documentation during "Tietorakenteet ja algoritmit harjoitustyö" where I developed the AIs for it. Even though the game's code and JavaDoc is in English, the documentation for the courses was written in Finnish as the courses were in Finnish.

I'm currently working on moving the game to Unity game engine to finish it properly. I might translate the documentation in the process too, if I decide to continue developing the game.
